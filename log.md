# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 0: April 14, Monday, 2025

**Today's Progress**: I've been working a lot on a project that a friend of mine suggested.
It's about an Angular drag-and-drop app using Python as the backend.
It's pretty good because it's helping me improve my full-stack skills.

I learned a lot about Python and backend today.

**Thoughts:** It's impressive what Chat-GPT can do. I never thought I was going to learn fast like that.

### Day 1: April 15, Tuesday, 2025

**Today's Progress**: With the help of chatGPT, I created a basic structure for the frontend, which requests the data and sends it to my Python backend via a POST method.

**Thoughts** It's a very simple application that transforms numbers in another numbers. Great project to learn.

### Day 2: April 16, Wednesday, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Had some trouble with ChatGPT, so I decided to start a new project using Angular and Python â€” a sort of Trello clone. I installed everything and created some components, but I didnâ€™t like the results and ended up restarting the projectâ€¦ like, three times. Letâ€™s see what happens tomorrow.

**Thoughts** What I really like to do is make videos, but I noticed that I was just creating the same kind of content as everyone else on YouTube. So now I'm thinking about how I can be truly original. In fact, I'm very tired and sleepy right now.

### Day 3: April 17, Thursday, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Decided to start a new project today. In fact, I decided to revive an old project of mine that I had lost. It's my portfolio, with my animations and stuff.

I decided to use a new web technology called Astro for this one.

My plan is to fill it with the things I like â€” lots of animations and cool effects, link my videos, and...

YEAAAAAH, LESSSSS GOOOOOOOOO!!! ðŸ˜¤ðŸš€

**Thoughts** I'm excited ðŸ˜ˆ

### Day 4: April 18, Friday, 2025

**Today's Progress**: More than 1 hour today, I generated some images with chatGPT and implemented a second screen below the first screen in my website. Learning a lot about this Astro technology.

**Thoughts** It's cool, like a game.

### Day 6: April 20, Sunday, 2025

**Today's Progress**: I was thinking about making some programs with Java yesterday. Today, I decided not to work on my portfolio and instead create some things with Java. I asked ChatGPT for a little help, and together we made some Hello World programs and a calculator. All of that was to help me learn more about interfaces in Java â€” something Iâ€™ve always been interested in.


**Thoughts** Today is a beautiful day, but it seems like it's gonna rain.

### Day 7: April 21, Monday, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Today I decided to give Python a try, and with a little help from ChatGPT, we made some fun little projects. I believe I learned a lot about the language. We built a snake game, a CSV analyzer, a guess-the-number game, and of course, a Hello World function. I also asked about AI development, but I guess it's a bit out of my scope for now...

**Thoughts** BORING. But we gotta do what we gotta do.

### Day 8: April 22, Tuesday, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Went to a little running earlier, today I was a little off head, not really sure what I wanted to learn. So I asked chat gpt to teach me a little of C++. I also looked for some repos so that I can help. I finish my hour working on my portfolio, I did a fast modal for an "About Me" section.

**Thoughts** I want a job.

**Today's Progress**: Did some animation tweaks in the about me modal in my porfolio, and also started learning some cybersecurity in tryhackme.

**Thoughts** Uhhhh hackerisms.

### Day 10: April 24, Thursday, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Today, I just decided to put a dancing baby in the project's popup â€” don't ask me why. 
Learned a lot about open ports and SSH today.
I even made a port scanner to check them, with a little help from GPT.
Let's go.

**Thoughts** Oh my god I can't believe it, I never been this far away from home.

<!-- ### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
