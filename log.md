# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 0: April 14, Monday, 2025

**Today's Progress**: I've been working a lot on a project that a friend of mine suggested.
It's about an Angular drag-and-drop app using Python as the backend.
It's pretty good because it's helping me improve my full-stack skills.

I learned a lot about Python and backend today.

**Thoughts:** It's impressive what Chat-GPT can do. I never thought I was going to learn fast like that.

### Day 1: April 15, Tuesday, 2025

**Today's Progress**: With the help of chatGPT, I created a basic structure for the frontend, which requests the data and sends it to my Python backend via a POST method.

**Thoughts** It's a very simple application that transforms numbers in another numbers. Great project to learn.

### Day 2: April 16, Wednesday, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Had some trouble with ChatGPT, so I decided to start a new project using Angular and Python — a sort of Trello clone. I installed everything and created some components, but I didn’t like the results and ended up restarting the project… like, three times. Let’s see what happens tomorrow.

**Thoughts** What I really like to do is make videos, but I noticed that I was just creating the same kind of content as everyone else on YouTube. So now I'm thinking about how I can be truly original. In fact, I'm very tired and sleepy right now.

### Day 3: April 17, Thursday, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Decided to start a new project today. In fact, I decided to revive an old project of mine that I had lost. It's my portfolio, with my animations and stuff.

I decided to use a new web technology called Astro for this one.

My plan is to fill it with the things I like — lots of animations and cool effects, link my videos, and...

YEAAAAAH, LESSSSS GOOOOOOOOO!!! 😤🚀

**Thoughts** I'm excited 😈

### Day 4: April 18, Friday, 2025

**Today's Progress**: More than 1 hour today, I generated some images with chatGPT and implemented a second screen below the first screen in my website. Learning a lot about this Astro technology.

**Thoughts** It's cool, like a game.

### Day 6: April 20, Sunday, 2025

**Today's Progress**: I was thinking about making some programs with Java yesterday. Today, I decided not to work on my portfolio and instead create some things with Java. I asked ChatGPT for a little help, and together we made some Hello World programs and a calculator. All of that was to help me learn more about interfaces in Java — something I’ve always been interested in.


**Thoughts** Today is a beautiful day, but it seems like it's gonna rain.

### Day 7: April 21, Monday, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Today I decided to give Python a try, and with a little help from ChatGPT, we made some fun little projects. I believe I learned a lot about the language. We built a snake game, a CSV analyzer, a guess-the-number game, and of course, a Hello World function. I also asked about AI development, but I guess it's a bit out of my scope for now...

**Thoughts** BORING. But we gotta do what we gotta do.

### Day 8: April 22, Tuesday, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Went to a little running earlier, today I was a little off head, not really sure what I wanted to learn. So I asked chat gpt to teach me a little of C++. I also looked for some repos so that I can help. I finish my hour working on my portfolio, I did a fast modal for an "About Me" section.

**Thoughts** I want a job.

### Day 9: April 23, Wednesday, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Did some animation tweaks in the about me modal in my porfolio, and also started learning some cybersecurity in tryhackme.

**Thoughts** Uhhhh hackerisms.

### Day 10: April 24, Thursday, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Today, I just decided to put a dancing baby in the project's popup — don't ask me why. 
Learned a lot about open ports and SSH today.
I even made a port scanner to check them, with a little help from GPT.
Let's go.

**Thoughts** Oh my god I can't believe it, I never been this far away from home.

### Day 11: April 25, Friday, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Decided to spent my time learning about ethical hacking today, I learned a lot about sql injection. Etc.

**Thoughts**: I'm discovering how to be amazing.

### Day 12: April 26, Saturday, 2025

**Today's Progress**: I decided to work on mobile development today. I went back to an old project — a game app focused on solving puzzles. I also started using a new AI called Cline to help with programming. It's a bit crazy sometimes, but when combined with GPT, things can get very interesting.

**Thoughts**: Robots are stealing my jobs.

### Day 13: April 27, Sunday, 2025

**Today's Progress**: I started to do some research about cloud computing and I ended up making an CRUD application with Python to learn more about SQL em backend. Very funny thing.

**Thoughts**: It's no joke.

### Day 14: April 28, Monday, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Today, my work was more focused on the mind. I spent some time reading about Shopify apps, and to make sure I actually did something, I decided to create a frontend for my Python CRUD application using Angular. My plan is to create a popup menu that opens when you interact with the items in the main menu. It's very ugly, I know — I don't master Angular yet.

**Thoughts**: Mayonaka no joke.

### Day 15: April 29, Tuesday, 2025

**Today's Progress**: I think I made good progress on the Python CRUD menu. Frontend is way harder than backend — I gotta admit it. Anyway, I created logic that returns a conditional menu based on the item the user clicked. I spent 50 minutes on that, and with the last 10 minutes, I added some basic styling so it wouldn’t look so ugly.

**Thoughts**: Intankable.

### Day 16: April 30, Wednesday, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Today I styled the submenus of my Python CRUD application. The frontend is powered by Angular.

**Thoughts**: Got a lot of things to do today.

### Day 17: May 1, Thursday, 2025

**Today's Progress**: I spent over an hour today just to make sure the frontend is fully connected to the backend. So basically, my CRUD is done — and I thought it was easy to build, thanks to ChatGPT’s help. I learned a lot from this project and I want to use more Python in the future, maybe even do something related to AI.

**Thoughts**: Now, I'm gonna play some oblivion in peace.

### Day 18: May 2, Friday, 2025

**Today's Progress**: I did something very interesting tonight. First of all, I fixed some bugs I had left in the Python CRUD. Then I worked on my puzzle Android app and implemented a logic to process the answers and move to the next puzzle. Now, I’ve just built a Hello World application in Android Studio. I’m thinking about creating a simple app to read and interpret EPUB files, so I can read my books without ads.

**Thoughts**: Friend of mine got his phone stolen today, I feel bad.

### Day 19: May 3, Saturday, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Today I made a click counter in Android Studio.

**Thoughts**: Very boring and hard. Still Learning I guess

### Day 20: May 4, Sunday, 2025

**Today's Progress**: In Android Studio, I started the epubReader project but ran into a lot of issues with imports and libraries. I guess I need to explore other options to see what works.

**Thoughts**: I'm hating android studio.

### Day 21: May 5, Monday, 2025

**Today's Progress**: I'm going to slow down a bit with the ebook reader while I properly learn how everything works in the Android Studio environment and Kotlin programming.

Today I decided to go back to the basics — printed some text and an image on the screen, wrapping it up with this lovely tribute to #nintendo 😍

**Thoughts**: Learning...

### Day 24: May 8, Thursday, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Felt like making a lava lamp today. I’ve been wrestling with how to simulate that liquid in a visually pleasing and physically satisfying way. Ended up playing around with two pretty interesting libraries focused on that:

Matter.js – Simulates 2D physics with rigid bodies, collisions, gravity, and realistic object interactions. Great for games, animations, and anything that needs physical behavior. Really fun for game-like stuff.
🔗 https://brm.io/matter-js/

LiquidFun – Simulates fluids and particles with organic behavior, like liquids that deform, flow, and merge together.
🔗 https://google.github.io/liquidfun/

**Thoughts**: Not what I want yet.

<!-- ### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
